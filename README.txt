TapAndMap is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (2 or 3), with the on-board Ethernet used to talk to it.
It will sniff from either two USB Ethernet dongles (acting as a bridge), or one USB Ethernet Dongle (connected to a spanning port or hub).
It will then plot the public points it sees on Google Maps, as well as displaying textual data on the packets.

Disclaimer:  I am not a web programmer, so use at your own risk.  I wouldn't put it facing the Internet, as it is probably vulnerable.
